I am an aspiring Data Scientist with a strong work ethic and a love for solving problems. 
While pursuing animation and game developement I discovered a passion for programming and sought to broaden my skillset.

From my previous experience in the design industry, I bring excellent time management skills, an attention to detail, 
the ability to self motivate, and experience working in teams and leading them. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on broadening my portfolio with some personal projects, as well as learning Pygame and C++
